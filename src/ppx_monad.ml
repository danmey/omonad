  (*
    Sometimes we can detect that a pattern p is 'exhaustive' -- i.e. that
    'function p -> () | _ -> ()' will cause a redundancy warning.  For
    example, variables are exhaustive, as are tuples of exhaustive patterns.

    In other cases we can detect that a pattern p is 'inexhaustive' --
    i.e. that 'function p -> () | _ -> ()' will not cause a redundancy
    warning.  For example, integer constants are inexhaustive, as are array
    patterns.

    In a third family of cases we cannot detect syntactically whether a
    pattern p is exhaustive or inexhaustive because we do not have access to
    enough information.  For example, whether a pattern constisting of a
    constructor C is exhaustive or inexhaustive depends on whether it is the
    only constructor for the datatype, and whether a polymorphic variant
    pattern with a type ascription (`C:t) is exhaustive depends on the
    definition of the type t.

    [Technical note: we base the definition of 'exhaustive' on redundancy
     warnings rather than exhaustiveness warnings to give the right behaviour
     for polymorphic variants.  Note that

        function `A -> ()

     does not cause an exhaustiveness warning (and so `A could be considered
     exhaustive), but

       function `A -> () | _ -> ()

     does not cause a redundancy warning (and so `A could be considered
     inexhaustive).  However, the input to the first function has type [< `A]
     rather than the more liberal type [> `A].  We want the more liberal type,
     which allows us to accept a  larger class of programs.]
